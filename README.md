# Hoshi Stars 星

The stars you can see without a telescope: 5,080 of them, with names, positions, proper motion, distance and colour. Typed, no dependencies, about 100 kB gzipped. Hoshi (星) is the Japanese word for a star.

```sh
npm install @johnmorrisdotca/hoshi-stars
```

```ts
import { starByName, starColour, starDistanceLightYears, starPosition, stars } from "@johnmorrisdotca/hoshi-stars";

const sirius = starByName("Sirius")!;
console.log(sirius.designation, sirius.magnitude, starColour(sirius));          // α CMa -1.46 #c9daff
console.log(starDistanceLightYears(sirius)?.toFixed(1), "light-years");          // 8.7
console.log(starPosition(starByName("Arcturus")!, Date.UTC(2100, 0, 1)));        // carried by its proper motion
console.log(stars({ magnitude: 2 }).length, "stars as bright as magnitude 2");    // 50
```

| Function | Gives |
|---|---|
| `stars({ magnitude? })` | the stars as bright as a magnitude, brightest first |
| `starByHr(hr)`, `starByName(text)` | one star by its Bright Star Catalogue number, or its name or designation |
| `starPosition(star, when?)` | right ascension and declination (degrees, J2000 frame) carried by proper motion |
| `starDistanceLightYears(star)` | the distance from the parallax |
| `starTemperatureK(bv)`, `blackBodyColour(kelvin)`, `starColour(star)` | temperature and a colour to draw |

Counts: 15 stars to magnitude 1, 50 to 2, 174 to 3, 518 to 4, 1,630 to 5 and 5,080 to 6.

## The 88 constellations

Their own import, about 2 kB gzipped, so the bright-star entry stays small. Each has its IAU abbreviation, Latin name and genitive, English name, and Japanese name with its hiragana reading (`おおいぬ座`, `おおいぬざ`).

```ts
import { constellation, constellations, starsIn } from "@johnmorrisdotca/hoshi-stars/constellations";

const dog = constellation("CMa")!;            // or "Canis Major", "Great Dog", "おおいぬ座", in any case
console.log(dog.name, dog.genitive, dog.english, dog.japanese, dog.reading);   // Canis Major Canis Majoris Great Dog おおいぬ座 おおいぬざ
console.log(constellations().length);                                          // 88
console.log(starsIn("Ori").slice(0, 2).map((s) => s.name));                   // [ 'Rigel', 'Betelgeuse' ]
```

| Function | Gives |
|---|---|
| `constellations()` | all 88, alphabetical by Latin name |
| `constellation(text)` | one, by abbreviation, Latin name, genitive, English name, Japanese name or reading; `undefined` if none (the English `Compass` is both Circinus and Pyxis, so it finds neither) |
| `starsIn(text)` | the bright stars that lie in it, brightest first (`RangeError` for a text that is no constellation) |

No lines or boundaries yet.

## Where the data comes from

The Yale Bright Star Catalogue (Hoffleit and Warren 1991), credited in [NOTICE.md](NOTICE.md). The larger catalogues (Hipparcos, Tycho, Gaia) are ESA's, licensed for non-commercial use only, so an MIT package cannot pass them on. Stars fainter than magnitude 6.0 are not in this package.

## Coming

Constellation lines and boundaries, deep-sky objects, a Milky Way outline and a star-chart function, each its own import. This package is the sky behind [wakusei-planets](https://github.com/johnmorrisdotca/wakusei-planets); it does not depend on it.
